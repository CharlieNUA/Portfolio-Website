       <h3>Hello I'm Charlie, and I'm a upcoming Games Developer!</h3>
       <p>
       Based in the uk, I'm currently in my third year of university at NUA (Norwich University of the Arts) studying Games Development to join the Games industry when I finish my learning and get a degree.
       My main interest is how games work and how you can affect them by changing small details, this had followed me with technology in general as I enjoy learning about new software, engines, components, peripherals and more. Through my course I have
       been able to pick up new game design techniques and work on projects that add to my game library and solidify working as a team to create something really special.</p>
       <p>My main engine i use to create games is unreal engine 4, which i have spent a good amount of time understanding what all the different features and functions do. While im well versed in blueprint I prefer using rider or visual studio
       to create the code that runs the game because you have so much more freedom and customizability to create what you want, which im still building on at university. The languages I know are HTML, Javascript, C++ and CSS which I have a decent understanding of how
       they work however I still have a keen interest in learning new coding languages since they can be a valuable asset to a game developer's arsenal.</p>
       <p>Outside of my studying i have been able to work with other students and people in the industry to create games for game jams and events which have been very fun and I enjoy competing in them, not only for my games but seeing what other
       groups have done and playtesting their games to see what works and what doesn't.</p>
       <p>I really enjoy watching and playing video games: some new and some old that give me inspiration to create something of my own with my look or idea. I've been playing games since I was at least 6 and have picked up many new genres and franchises
     along the way, that shaped what I like today.</p>
