       <h3 >University Work</h3>
       <p>
       Over the two years of university i have had the chance to work on lots of different games that
       have improved my game designing techniques and coding knowledge massively. Some of these projects are not finished however
       they have been really fun to work on. As well as meeting new people in the industry along the way and strengthing
       my experience in games development.

       Originaly the design was a water management game that used a block to reflect water into a goal, however, after working
       with the Unreals Niagara system I thought this would take too long for the time we had set for our project. So instead this was turned into
       a laser beam game using Unreals line trace and calculating the reflection on mirror objects. Which I worked on as a solo project to get fully
       finished and playable with 20 levels.

       Made for the Global Games Jam 2022, I worked on this with another Developer and an Artist to create
       a third-person shooter classic sci-fi over a couple of days. My main focus on this game was the robot enemies that chase the player around the map
       and also Spent a lot of time on the gravity effect to make all the items and islands float which then would react to the player's movement.

       <p>
         This game was a big group project between a group of people i hadn't met before, my job alongside an indie developer was to create a text-based game in ue4.
          However, our expectations of what we could get done were a lot more than we could so the game was left unfinished but enough for the project since it was only a game prototype.
          My main focus on this project was the entire communication between the player and the AI which lets the player talk to different characters and the choices/responses affect the environment around it.

     <p>
       This game was planned and built for my final project at the end of my first year at university which could then show off what I had picked up along the way.
       The focus of this project was create a puzzle game that could be challenging for the player, this lead me down the route of creating blocks that randomly spawn each round
       so every single round will be different and unpredictable.
       This was another project that I ended up working on a lot outside
       of the university to complete and fully flesh it out so it has lots of different levels.
       Not forgetting extra Hud screens and a huge improvement to the player experience by fixing bugs and smoother movement.

     <p>
       Leaf worm was a game created for the Global Games Jam 2023 just by myself and the addition of free assets
       I could find online over two days. For that particular games jam, I decided to compete by myself to see what I could do
       in this short period. This was my first experience making a 2d game in unity which I think was quite successful.
       The game is quite underdeveloped however it is playable and each time it is played the game will be different, there isn’t
       much more difficulty since it's more about collecting items at the player's pace but it's a fun little game I'm happy I could work on.

   <h3>Untitled Tower Defence</h3>
     <p>
       This tower defence game is currently my main focus of work, in my last year of university I have been
       given the chance to work on a game for a really good amount of time which gives me well enough time to
        finish the game, polish it and publish to a proper games website such as steam. The game idea is a top-down
        3d tower defence, fantasy-themed with Orcs, trolls, goblins and more that will try to storm the bases which
         the player has to stop with various fantasy characters with different abilities and characteristics.
</p><p>
         This is also my first attempt at creating a 3d game in Unity as I usually stick to Unreal Engine so
         it has been a different experience working with a different system and finding the advantages and
         disadvantages of using different software.
