       <h3>University Work</h3>
       <p>
       Over the two years of university i have had the chance to work on lots of different games that
       have improved my game designing techniques and coding knowledge massively. Some of these projects are not finished however
       they have been really fun to work on. As well as meeting new people in the industry along the way and strengthing
       my experience in games development.

     <p>
       Laser Beam is a top down puzzle game that makes the player use light reflections to hit the targets and progress to the next level, the player also has the added
       difficultly of obstacles that might get in the way or tricky movements to work around. There are 20 levels in the game that add new puzzles for the player to work
       on top of this the player has to complete this before the timer runs out.There is a good amount of customisation in this game as the player can now change the color
       beam to any color of choice.

              <p>
                Originaly the design was a water management game that used a block to reflect water into a goal,
                 however, after working with the Unreals Niagara system I thought this would take too long for the
                  time we had set for our project. So instead this was turned into a laser beam game using Unreals line
                   trace and calculating the reflection on mirror objects. Which I worked on as a solo project to get fully
                finished and playable with 20 levels.

                <br>
                Laser Beams main focus was to be a puzzle game so alot of the time and research was spent on learning how to make things more difficult and what makes levels harder than
                others, so i could then have a progressing game that became more and more difficult as the player progresses but also teaches the player new
                skills that feel rewarding later on.

                <h4>Basic Mechanics</h4>

              <br><br>
               <p>The main movement for the cube is sorted out through a variable which can be effected by pressing either A or D,
              which will then rotate the cube either clockwise or anti-clockwise depending on what button is pressed. The linetrace is stored inside
              the cube which will draw a line between the cube and the edges of the map unless the line trace hits a perticular material which in this
              case its the glass material and that then spawns in another line trace and so forth.</p>
              </p>
               <img class="method" style="width: 20%" style="height: 20%" style="align-content: left"src="images\Laserbeamworkingpogress.png" alt="Laser beam working in progress">
               <br><br>
               <p>The linetrace can then detect wether its hitting another reflective material in which it will spawn another that has
               the same behaviour, if the line trace doesn't detect that exact material name it will just draw the black line.This indicates
               that the line trace has ended and its not hit a target.

               To calculate the angle of the other light reflection the trace will then take into account the direction its coming from and then
               reflect it on a oppersite angle so if the beam is going down right it will then reflect up right as the picture shows above.</p>

     <p>
       Made for the Global Games Jam 2022, I worked on this with another Developer and an Artist to create
       a third-person shooter classic sci-fi over a couple of days. My main focus on this game was the robot enemies that chase the player around the map
       and also Spent a lot of time on the gravity effect to make all the items and islands float which then would react to the player's movement.

               <p>
                   Space Cat Nip is mainly just a simple platformer with some added extra gravity effects that make it alot of fun for the player to jump
                   around on floating islands and push rocks around the map.The main movement is done through UE4 character controller so WASD will move
                   the character and space will make it jump, after aspect we spent a good amount of time on was the UE4 character components air movement as
                   with this we could then give the player character space like movement so the character would be able to control alot in the air and the
                   gravity would be very small falling when the character jumps of a rock making it easy to land on small ones.
                   <br>
                   Since this was intended for a games jam the time we had to work on it was only two days so the scope had to be quite small, however it still includes
                   a couple of basic mechanics which makes it fun to play and go through the levels.With the robot enemies that show up later on the game does then have
                   some small difficulty as the robots can then chase the player down.
               </p>
               <h4>AI Behaviour</h4>
               <img class="method" style="width: 20%" style="height: 20%" style="align-content: left"src="images\spacecatnipAIBehaviour.PNG" alt="Space Cat Nip working in progress">
               <br><br>
               <p>The Robot enemies where a idea we came up with later on in the jam so they didn't have much time for us to develop on however with the UE4 AI behaviour
               trees we could get a simple patroling and chasing player implemented into the game.So the Robots behaviour will make it find a location at random on
               the nav mesh its using so for this it would be the islands top face, and then move to it which it then can repeat the process.If the enemy detects the
               player in its line of sight it can set the players position as the target and then move to that.As we needed a way of dying the player takes damage every
               so seconds after the player has taken damage for the first time.</p>
               </p>
               <h4>Gravity Effects</h4>
               <img class="method" style="width: 20%" style="height: 20%" style="align-content: left"src="images\GravityMovement.PNG" alt="Laser beam working in progress">
               <br><br>
               <p>For the Gravity effects on objects this was something i spent alot of time on as i saw it as a fun challenge to work on and it would add
               alot of "Game Feel to the game since its all based around space.So that this could be used on any object i created the base of this through C++ which
                   definately was much more difficult than all blueprint but it was a good chance to learn about 3d physics as i hadn't had much time to work in this field
                   before and i found it very intresting.
                   <br><br>
                   For this script it sets up the variable that the blueprints then uses to create the line trace between the island and the item below it to calculate the amount to float
                   and if the player then adds force to the island going downward it can adjust for that.With the variable of hover force made available to change in the editor
                   it then makes it easier to work with different sizes of objects such as small rocks</p>

       <p>
         Small stalks is a text based, top down game where you play as a farmer and the way the main plants would grow would be depending
          on the decisions/dialogue the player conveys to the AI characters when talking to them.The plants can then grow better or worse depending these respones or general chat with characters around the game.My general focus as the only
          game developer was to work on the dialogue system for the game since it was the main bases of it, it then couldnt be hard coded as it needed to be easy for other people in the team to add lots of dialogue and repsonses easily.

               <p>
                 This game was created for a second year University project between a large group of students and myself, over a couple of weeks to create a working demo or game.My role alongside an indie developer was to create the dialogue system in ue4.
                  However, our expectations of what we could get done were a lot higher than realistically possible, which has lead to the game being left unfinished but enough for the university submission since it was only a game prototype that was needed.
                  My main focus on this project was the entire communication between the player and the AI which lets the player talk to different characters and the choices/responses affect the environment around it.

                 </p>
                 <h4>Pickup & Inventory System</h4>
                 <img class="method" style="width: 75%" style="height: 75%" style="align-content: left"src="images\smallstalkspickup.png" alt="Laser beam working in progress">
               <br><br>
                <p>Since the game needed more for the player to be doing than just talking to these characters all the time we implemented a pickup system so that the player can pick up items like a watering can, fill it up and uses it to keep the plants alive, and this would then
                become a system that the plants have a happiniess and water level which is visible on the screen and the player has to keep running around to make sure these levels don't drop to nothing and the plants then die.</p>

                <p>For this i had to do alot of research into creating pickups that could then be placed into a inventory system and used on a button press, however the one side of the design of the game that worked well in my favour was that the player can only pick up one at a time, Which
                meant that it was more a case of changing a variable or system on the player so know what they are holding.So each item is then fed through a array on the player that then gets updated every time the player adds to or removes from the inventory. This
               then could be used for the visual inventory hud on the screen so the player can see what items are picked up. Another idea the gorup came up with was for items to wear away or become unusable so they would have to keep picking up these items, however there wasn't enough time
             in the project for this.</p>

       This game was planned and built for my final project at the end of my first year at university which could then show off what I had picked up along the way.
       The focus of this project was create a puzzle game that could be challenging for the player, this lead me down the route of creating blocks that randomly spawn each round
       so every single round will be different and unpredictable.
       This was another project that I ended up working on a lot outside
       of the university to complete and fully flesh it out so it has lots of different levels.
       Not forgetting extra Hud screens and a huge improvement to the player experience by fixing bugs and smoother movement.

       Leaf worm was a game created for the Global Games Jam 2023 just by myself and the addition of free assets
       I could find online over two days. For that particular games jam, I decided to compete by myself to see what I could do
       in this short period. This was my first experience making a 2d game in unity which I think was quite successful.
       The game is quite underdeveloped however it is playable and each time it is played the game will be different, there isn’t
       much more difficulty since it's more about collecting items at the player's pace but it's a fun little game I'm happy I could work on.

   <h3>Untitled Tower Defence</h3>
     <p>
       This tower defence game is currently my main focus of work, in my last year of university I have been
       given the chance to work on a game for a really good amount of time which gives me well enough time to
        finish the game, polish it and publish to a proper games website such as steam. The game idea is a top-down
        3d tower defence, fantasy-themed with Orcs, trolls, goblins and more that will try to storm the bases which
         the player has to stop with various fantasy characters with different abilities and characteristics.

         This is also my first attempt at creating a 3d game in Unity as I usually stick to Unreal Engine so
         it has been a different experience working with a different system and finding the advantages and
         disadvantages of using different software.

   <div class="accordion" id="accordionExample"  style="background-color: lightgray">
     <div class="accordion-item"  style="background-color: lightgray">
         <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseSix" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseSix" style="background-color: #999999">

       <div id="collapseSix" class="accordion-collapse collapse hidden" aria-labelledby="headingSix" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample" style="background-color: DarkGray">

           <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
